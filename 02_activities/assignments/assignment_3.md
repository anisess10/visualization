# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
    > The dataset i selected is the Toronto Island Ferry Ticket Counts, This dataset provides near real-time information about Toronto Island ferry ticket sales and ticket redemptions.
    > Link to the Dataset: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-island-ferry-ticket-counts/


- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
![alt text](<Python 2.png>) ![alt text](python3.png) ![alt text](<Python 1.png>) ![alt text](<PBI Viz.png>)
- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
        + For this assignment i used Python and Power BI as my visualization softwares
    > Who is your intended audience? 
        + Ferry Operations Managers and Transit Planners: Those responsible for managing and optimizing the Toronto Island Ferry service.
        + City Officials and Policy Makers: Interested in transit performance, public transportation usage, and infrastructure planning.
        + Advocay Groups or Analysts and Researchers: Focused on  interested in traffic safety, environmental impacts, and availability  of transportation options to Toronto isalnd.

    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
        + Usage Trends: Showing  ticket sales  to highlight peak periods and operational trends.
        + Seasonal Patterns: Illustrating seasonal, monthly, or hourly variations in ferry usage to support decision-making for scheduling and resource allocation.

    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 
        + Substantive:
                Focused on key metricsâ€”ticket sales  directly address service performance.
                Excluded less relevant details (like transaction IDs or redemptions) to keep the message clear.
        +Perceptual:
                Applied clear color gradients in the heatmap to differentiate high and low activity periods.
                Used grouped bars in the bar chart to facilitate side-by-side comparisons of different time periods.
        +Aesthetic:
                I Chose a clean, minimal layout with legible fonts and consistent color schemes.
                Ensured that titles, labels, and legends are clear, reducing visual clutter and enhancing readability.

    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
        + I used Python with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Documented the code steps, so anyone with the same dataset and code can reproduce the visualizations.
        + In the case of PBI viz where the visualization is not reproducible , it would make it difficult for others to vet my work or build on what i have already done, thus, limiting transparency and relaibility 

    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
        + Through pushing to Github for vetting and validation by support staff or DSI participants
        + Color Choices: Selected color-blind friendly legends.
        + Clear Labeling

    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
        + Ferry Riders and Commuters: Understanding service patterns can affect travel decisions and satisfaction.
        + Local Residents and Tourists: Insights into ferry usage may influence local business hours, transit planning, and tourist information.
        + City and Transit Planners: Data-driven insights can guide operational improvements, budget allocations, and future infrastructure development decisions.

    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
        + I included the most important features like date/timestamp and sales count so i can drive trend analysis in ticket sales 
        + I didn't use any Metadata like transaction ID as it does not contribute to understanding the overall ferry usage trends 
    
    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?
        + Data Transformation: Extracting relevant time components (like day, month, and hour) from the timestamp to aggregate data appropriately.
        redemption counts are correctly parsed.
        + Iterative Design: Experimenting with multiple chart types (e.g., bar charts, heatmaps, line charts) and adjusting layouts, color schemes, and annotations to find the most effective way to communicate the insights.
        + Making sure my code is reproducible by documenting and annotating each step 


- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
